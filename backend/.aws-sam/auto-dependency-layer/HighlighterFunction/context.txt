User guide for this offence

    Guideline users should be aware that the Equal Treatment Bench Book covers important aspects of fair treatment and disparity of outcomes for different groups in the criminal justice system. It provides guidance which sentencers are encouraged to take into account wherever applicable, to ensure that there is fairness for all involved in court proceedings.

Applicability

    For racially or religiously aggravated offences the category of the offence should be identified with reference to the factors below, and the sentence increased in accordance with the guidance at Step Three

Step 1 – Determining the offence category

The court should determine the offence category with reference only to the factors listed in the tables below. In order to determine the category the court should assess culpability and harm.
Culpability

The level of culpability is determined by weighing all the factors of the case. Where there are characteristics present which fall under different levels of culpability, the court should balance these characteristics giving appropriate weight to relevant factors to reach a fair assessment of the offender’s culpability.
A – High culpability

    Significant degree of planning or premeditation
    Victim obviously vulnerable due to age, personal characteristics or circumstances
    Use of a highly dangerous weapon or weapon equivalent*
    Strangulation/suffocation/asphyxiation
    Leading role in group activity
    Prolonged/persistent assault

B – Medium culpability

    Use of a weapon or weapon equivalent which does not fall within category A
    Lesser role in group activity
    Cases falling between category A or C because:
        Factors in both high and lesser categories are present which balance each other out; and/or
        The offender’s culpability falls between the factors as described in high and lesser culpability

C – Lesser culpability

    No weapon used
    Excessive self defence
    Impulsive/spontaneous and short-lived assault
    Mental disorder or learning disability, where linked to the commission of the offence

* A highly dangerous weapon can include weapons such as knives and firearms. Highly dangerous weapon equivalents can include corrosive substances (such as acid), whose dangerous nature must be substantially above and beyond the legislative definition of an offensive weapon which is; ‘any article made or adapted for use for causing injury, or is intended by the person having it with him for such use’.  The court must determine whether the weapon or weapon equivalent is highly dangerous on the facts and circumstances of the case.
Harm
Category 1

    Serious physical injury or serious psychological harm and/or substantial impact upon victim

Category 2

    Harm falling between categories 1 and 3

Category 3

    Some level of physical injury or psychological harm with limited impact upon victim

Step 2 – Starting point and category range

Having determined the category, the court should use the corresponding starting points to reach a sentence within the category range below. The starting point applies to all offenders irrespective of plea or previous convictions. A case of particular gravity, reflected by multiple features of culpability in step one, could merit upward adjustment from the starting point before further adjustment for aggravating or mitigating features, set out below.

    Sentencers should be aware that there is evidence of a disparity in sentence outcomes for this offence which indicates that a higher proportion of Black and Mixed ethnicity offenders receive an immediate custodial sentence than White, Asian and Chinese or Other ethnicity offenders. There may be many reasons for these differences, but in order to apply the guidelines fairly sentencers may find useful information and guidance at Chapter 8 paragraphs 186 to 206 of the Equal Treatment Bench Book.

The table below contains a non-exhaustive list of additional factual elements providing the context of the offence and factors relating to the offender. Identify whether any combination of these, or other relevant factors, should result in an upward or downward adjustment from the starting point. In some cases, having considered these factors, it may be appropriate to move outside the identified category range.
Factors increasing seriousness
Statutory aggravating factors:

    Previous convictions,
    having regard to a) the nature of the offence to which the conviction relates and its relevance to the current offence; and b) the time that has elapsed since the conviction
    Offence committed whilst on bail
    Offence motivated by, or demonstrating hostility based on any of the following characteristics or presumed characteristics of the victim: disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity
    Offence was committed against an emergency worker acting in the exercise of functions as such a worker
    Offence was committed against person providing a public service, performing a public duty or providing services to the public

Other aggravating factors:

    Deliberate spitting or coughing
    Offence committed against those working in the public sector or providing a service to the public or against a person coming to the assistance of an emergency worker
    Offence committed in prison (where not taken into account as a statutory aggravating factor)
    Offence committed in a domestic context
    History of violence or abuse towards victim by offender
    Presence of children
    Gratuitous degradation of victim
    Abuse of power and/or position of trust
    Any steps taken to prevent the victim reporting an incident, obtaining assistance and/or from assisting or supporting the prosecution
    Commission of offence whilst under the influence of alcohol/drugs
    Offence committed whilst on licence or subject to post sentence supervision
    Failure to comply with current court orders

Factors reducing seriousness or reflecting personal mitigation

    No previous convictions or no relevant/recent convictions
    Remorse
    Good character and/or exemplary conduct
    Significant degree of provocation
    History of significant violence or abuse towards the offender by the victim
    Age and/or lack of maturity
    Mental disorder or learning disability, where not linked to the commission of the offence
    Sole or primary carer for dependent relative(s)
    Determination and/or demonstration of steps taken to address addiction or offending behaviour
    Serious medical conditions requiring urgent, intensive or long-term treatment

Step 3 – Aggravated offences

SECTION 29 RACIALLY OR RELIGIOUSLY AGGRAVATED OFFENCES ONLY

Having determined the category of the basic offence to identify the sentence of a non-aggravated offence, the court should now consider the level of racial or religious aggravation involved and apply an appropriate uplift to the sentence in accordance with the guidance below. The following is a list of factors which the court should consider to determine the level of aggravation. Where there are characteristics present which fall under different levels of aggravation, the court should balance these to reach a fair assessment of the level of aggravation present in the offence.

Maximum sentence for the aggravated offence on indictment is 7 years’ custody (maximum when tried summarily is 6 months’ custody)

    Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors already taken into account in assessing the level of harm at step one

HIGH LEVEL OF RACIAL OR RELIGIOUS AGGRAVATION
	

SENTENCE UPLIFT

    Racial or religious aggravation was the predominant motivation for the offence.
    Offender was a member of, or was associated with, a group promoting hostility based on race or religion.
    Aggravated nature of the offence caused severe distress to the victim or the victim’s family (over and above the distress already considered at step one).
    Aggravated nature of the offence caused serious fear and distress throughout local community or more widely.

	

Increase the length of custodial sentence if already considered for the basic offence or consider a custodial sentence, if not already considered for the basic offence.

 

MEDIUM LEVEL OF RACIAL OR RELIGIOUS AGGRAVATION
	

SENTENCE UPLIFT

    Racial or religious aggravation formed a significant proportion of the offence as a whole.
    Aggravated nature of the offence caused some distress to the victim or the victim’s family (over and above the distress already considered at step one).
    Aggravated nature of the offence caused some fear and distress throughout local community or more widely.

	

Consider a significantly more onerous penalty of the same type or consider a more severe type of sentence than for the basic offence.

 

LOW LEVEL OF RACIAL OR RELIGIOUS AGGRAVATION
	

SENTENCE UPLIFT

    Aggravated element formed a minimal part of the offence as a whole.
    Aggravated nature of the offence caused minimal or no distress to the victim or the victim’s family (over and above the distress already considered at step one). 

	

Consider a more onerous penalty of the same type identified for the basic offence.

 

Magistrates may find that, although the appropriate sentence for the basic offence would be within their powers, the appropriate increase for the aggravated offence would result in a sentence in excess of their powers. If so, they must commit for sentence to the Crown Court.

The sentencer should state in open court that the offence was aggravated by reason of race or religion, and should also state what the sentence would have been without that element of aggravation.
Step 4 – Consider any other factors which indicate a reduction, such as assistance to the prosecution

The court should take into account section 74 of the Sentencing Code (reduction in sentence for assistance to prosecution) and any other rule of law by virtue of which an offender may receive a discounted sentence in consequence of assistance given (or offered) to the prosecutor or investigator.
Step 5 – Reduction for guilty pleas

The court should take account of any potential reduction for a guilty plea in accordance with section 73 of the Sentencing Code and the Reduction in Sentence for a Guilty Plea guideline.
Step 6 – Dangerousness

The court should consider whether having regard to the criteria contained in Chapter 6 of Part 10 of the Sentencing Code it would be appropriate to impose an extended sentence (sections 266 and 279).
Step 7 – Totality principle

If sentencing an offender for more than one offence, or where the offender is already serving a sentence, consider whether the total sentence is just and proportionate to the offending behaviour. See Totality guideline.
Step 8 – Compensation and ancillary orders

In all cases, the court should consider whether to make compensation and/or other ancillary orders. The court must give reasons if it decides not to order compensation (Sentencing Code, s.55).

    Ancillary orders – Magistrates’ Court
    Ancillary orders – Crown Court Compendium

Step 9 – Reasons

Section 52 of the Sentencing Code imposes a duty to give reasons for, and explain the effect of, the sentence. 
Step 10 – Consideration for time spent on bail (tagged curfew)

The court must consider whether to give credit for time spent on bail in accordance with section 240A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and section 325 of the Sentencing Code.
