Culpability

The level of culpability is determined by weighing all the factors of the case. Where there are characteristics present which fall under different levels of culpability, the court should balance these characteristics giving appropriate weight to relevant factors to reach a fair assessment of the offender’s culpability.
A – High culpability

    Significant degree of planning or premeditation
    Victim obviously vulnerable due to age, personal characteristics or circumstances
    Use of a highly dangerous weapon or weapon equivalent*
    Strangulation/suffocation/asphyxiation
    Leading role in group activity
    Prolonged/persistent assault

B – Medium culpability

    Use of a weapon or weapon equivalent which does not fall within category A
    Lesser role in group activity
    Cases falling between category A or C because:
        Factors in both high and lesser categories are present which balance each other out; and/or
        The offender’s culpability falls between the factors as described in high and lesser culpability

C – Lesser culpability

    No weapon used
    Excessive self defence
    Impulsive/spontaneous and short-lived assault
    Mental disorder or learning disability, where linked to the commission of the offence

* A highly dangerous weapon can include weapons such as knives and firearms. Highly dangerous weapon equivalents can include corrosive substances (such as acid), whose dangerous nature must be substantially above and beyond the legislative definition of an offensive weapon which is; ‘any article made or adapted for use for causing injury, or is intended by the person having it with him for such use’.  The court must determine whether the weapon or weapon equivalent is highly dangerous on the facts and circumstances of the case.


Harm
Category 1

    Serious physical injury or serious psychological harm and/or substantial impact upon victim

Category 2

    Harm falling between categories 1 and 3

Category 3

    Some level of physical injury or psychological harm with limited impact upon victim


Factors increasing seriousness
Statutory aggravating factors:

    Previous convictions,
    having regard to a) the nature of the offence to which the conviction relates and its relevance to the current offence; and b) the time that has elapsed since the conviction
    Offence committed whilst on bail
    Offence motivated by, or demonstrating hostility based on any of the following characteristics or presumed characteristics of the victim: disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity
    Offence was committed against an emergency worker acting in the exercise of functions as such a worker
    Offence was committed against person providing a public service, performing a public duty or providing services to the public

Other aggravating factors:

    Deliberate spitting or coughing
    Offence committed against those working in the public sector or providing a service to the public or against a person coming to the assistance of an emergency worker
    Offence committed in prison (where not taken into account as a statutory aggravating factor)
    Offence committed in a domestic context
    History of violence or abuse towards victim by offender
    Presence of children
    Gratuitous degradation of victim
    Abuse of power and/or position of trust
    Any steps taken to prevent the victim reporting an incident, obtaining assistance and/or from assisting or supporting the prosecution
    Commission of offence whilst under the influence of alcohol/drugs

    Effective from: 01 October 2019

        Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence

    The fact that an offender is voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the offence will tend to increase the seriousness of the offence provided that the intoxication has contributed to the offending.

    This applies regardless of whether the offender is under the influence of legal or illegal substance(s).

    In the case of a person addicted to drugs or alcohol the intoxication may be considered not to be voluntary, but the court should have regard to the extent to which the offender has sought help or engaged with any assistance which has been offered or made available in dealing with the addiction.

    An offender who has voluntarily consumed drugs and/or alcohol must accept the consequences of the behaviour that results, even if it is out of character.

     
    Offence committed whilst on licence or subject to post sentence supervision

    Effective from: 01 October 2019

        Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence

        An offender who is subject to licence or post sentence supervision is under a particular obligation to desist from further offending.
        The extent to which the offender has complied with the conditions of a licence or order (including the time that has elapsed since its commencement) will be a relevant consideration.
        Where the offender is dealt with separately for a breach of a licence or order regard should be had to totality.
        Care should be taken to avoid double counting matters taken into account when considering previous convictions.

    When sentencing young adult offenders (typically aged 18-25), consideration should also be given to the guidance on the mitigating factor relating to age and/or lack of maturity when considering the significance of this factor.
    Failure to comply with current court orders

    Effective from: 01 October 2019

        Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence

        Commission of an offence while subject to a relevant court order makes the offence more serious.
        The extent to which the offender has complied with the conditions of an order (including the time that has elapsed since its commencement) will be a relevant consideration.
        Where the offender is dealt with separately for a breach of an order regard should be had to totality
        Care should be taken to avoid double counting matters taken into account when considering previous convictions.

    When sentencing young adult offenders (typically aged 18-25), consideration should also be given to the guidance on the mitigating factor relating to age and/or lack of maturity when considering the significance of this factor.



Factors reducing seriousness or reflecting personal mitigation

    No previous convictions or no relevant/recent convictions
    Remorse
    Good character and/or exemplary conduct
    Significant degree of provocation
    History of significant violence or abuse towards the offender by the victim
    Age and/or lack of maturity
    Mental disorder or learning disability, where not linked to the commission of the offence
    Sole or primary carer for dependent relative(s)
    Determination and/or demonstration of steps taken to address addiction or offending behaviour
    Serious medical conditions requiring urgent, intensive or long-term treatment


Step 3 – Aggravated offences

SECTION 29 RACIALLY OR RELIGIOUSLY AGGRAVATED OFFENCES ONLY

Having determined the category of the basic offence to identify the sentence of a non-aggravated offence, the court should now consider the level of racial or religious aggravation involved and apply an appropriate uplift to the sentence in accordance with the guidance below. The following is a list of factors which the court should consider to determine the level of aggravation. Where there are characteristics present which fall under different levels of aggravation, the court should balance these to reach a fair assessment of the level of aggravation present in the offence.

Maximum sentence for the aggravated offence on indictment is 7 years’ custody (maximum when tried summarily is 6 months’ custody)

    Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors already taken into account in assessing the level of harm at step one

HIGH LEVEL OF RACIAL OR RELIGIOUS AGGRAVATION
	

SENTENCE UPLIFT

    Racial or religious aggravation was the predominant motivation for the offence.
    Offender was a member of, or was associated with, a group promoting hostility based on race or religion.
    Aggravated nature of the offence caused severe distress to the victim or the victim’s family (over and above the distress already considered at step one).
    Aggravated nature of the offence caused serious fear and distress throughout local community or more widely.

	

Increase the length of custodial sentence if already considered for the basic offence or consider a custodial sentence, if not already considered for the basic offence.

 

MEDIUM LEVEL OF RACIAL OR RELIGIOUS AGGRAVATION
	

SENTENCE UPLIFT

    Racial or religious aggravation formed a significant proportion of the offence as a whole.
    Aggravated nature of the offence caused some distress to the victim or the victim’s family (over and above the distress already considered at step one).
    Aggravated nature of the offence caused some fear and distress throughout local community or more widely.

	

Consider a significantly more onerous penalty of the same type or consider a more severe type of sentence than for the basic offence.

 

LOW LEVEL OF RACIAL OR RELIGIOUS AGGRAVATION
	

SENTENCE UPLIFT

    Aggravated element formed a minimal part of the offence as a whole.
    Aggravated nature of the offence caused minimal or no distress to the victim or the victim’s family (over and above the distress already considered at step one). 

	

Consider a more onerous penalty of the same type identified for the basic offence.

 

Magistrates may find that, although the appropriate sentence for the basic offence would be within their powers, the appropriate increase for the aggravated offence would result in a sentence in excess of their powers. If so, they must commit for sentence to the Crown Court.

The sentencer should state in open court that the offence was aggravated by reason of race or religion, and should also state what the sentence would have been without that element of aggravation.
