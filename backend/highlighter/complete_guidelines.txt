The guidelines are:

Assault occasioning actual bodily harm / Racially or religiously aggravated ABH Crime and Disorder Act 1998, s.29, Offences against the Person Act 1861, s.47 Guideline effective from: 1 July 2021 Assault occasioning actual bodily harm, Offences against the Person Act 1861 (section 47) Racially or religiously aggravated ABH, Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (section 29) Triable either way Section 47 Maximum: 5 years’ custody Offence range: Fine – 4 years’ custody Section 29 Maximum: 7 years’ custody These are specified offences for the purposes of sections 266 and 279 (extended sentence for certain violent, sexual or terrorism offences) of the Sentencing Code. User guide for this offence Guideline users should be aware that the Equal Treatment Bench Book covers important aspects of fair treatment and disparity of outcomes for different groups in the criminal justice system. It provides guidance which sentencers are encouraged to take into account wherever applicable, to ensure that there is fairness for all involved in court proceedings. Applicability In accordance with section 120 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, the Sentencing Council issues this definitive guideline. It applies to all offenders aged 18 and older, who are sentenced on or after the effective date of this guideline, regardless of the date of the offence.* Section 59(1) of the Sentencing Code provides that:“Every court –must, in sentencing an offender, follow any sentencing guidelines which are relevant to the offender’s case, and must, in exercising any other function relating to the sentencing of offenders, follow any sentencing guidelines which are relevant to the exercise of the function, unless the court is satisfied that it would be contrary to the interests of justice to do so.”This guideline applies only to offenders aged 18 and older. General principles to be considered in the sentencing of children and young people are in the Sentencing Council definitive guideline, Overarching Principles – Sentencing Children and Young People. *The maximum sentence that applies to an offence is the maximum that applied at the date of the offence. For racially or religiously aggravated offences the category of the offence should be identified with reference to the factors below, and the sentence increased in accordance with the guidance at Step Three Step 1 – Determining the offence category The court should determine the offence category with reference only to the factors listed in the tables below. In order to determine the category the court should assess culpability and harm. Culpability The level of culpability is determined by weighing all the factors of the case. Where there are characteristics present which fall under different levels of culpability, the court should balance these characteristics giving appropriate weight to relevant factors to reach a fair assessment of the offender’s culpability. A – High culpability Significant degree of planning or premeditation Victim obviously vulnerable due to age, personal characteristics or circumstances Use of a highly dangerous weapon or weapon equivalent. A highly dangerous weapon can include weapons such as knives and firearms. Highly dangerous weapon equivalents can include corrosive substances (such as acid), whose dangerous nature must be substantially above and beyond the legislative definition of an offensive weapon which is; ‘any article made or adapted for use for causing injury, or is intended by the person having it with him for such use’.  The court must determine whether the weapon or weapon equivalent is highly dangerous on the facts and circumstances of the case. Strangulation/suffocation/asphyxiation Leading role in group activity Prolonged/persistent assault B – Medium culpability Use of a weapon or weapon equivalent which does not fall within category A Lesser role in group activity Cases falling between category A or C because: Factors in both high and lesser categories are present which balance each other out; and/or The offender’s culpability falls between the factors as described in high and lesser culpability C – Lesser culpability No weapon used Excessive self defence Impulsive/spontaneous and short-lived assault Mental disorder or learning disability, where linked to the commission of the offence Harm Category 1 Serious physical injury or serious psychological harm and/or substantial impact upon victim Category 2 Harm falling between categories 1 and 3 Category 3 Some level of physical injury or psychological harm with limited impact upon victim Step 2 – Starting point and category range Having determined the category, the court should use the corresponding starting points to reach a sentence within the category range below. The starting point applies to all offenders irrespective of plea or previous convictions. A case of particular gravity, reflected by multiple features of culpability in step one, could merit upward adjustment from the starting point before further adjustment for aggravating or mitigating features, set out below. Sentencers should be aware that there is evidence of a disparity in sentence outcomes for this offence which indicates that a higher proportion of Black and Mixed ethnicity offenders receive an immediate custodial sentence than White, Asian and Chinese or Other ethnicity offenders. There may be many reasons for these differences, but in order to apply the guidelines fairly sentencers may find useful information and guidance at Chapter 8 paragraphs 186 to 206 of the Equal Treatment Bench Book. Harm 	  	Culpability 	 A 	B 	C Harm 1 	Starting point 2 years 6 months’ custody Starting point 1 year 6 months’ custody Starting point 36 weeks’ custody Category range 1 year 6 months’ – 4 years’ custody Category range 36 weeks’  – 2 years 6 months’ custody Category range High level community order – 1 year 6 months’ custody Harm 2 Starting point 1 year 6 months’ custody Starting point 36 weeks’ custody Starting point High level community order Category range 36 weeks’ – 2 years 6 months’ custody Category range High level community order – 1 year 6 months’ custody Category range Low level community order – 36 weeks’ custody Harm 3 	Starting point 36 weeks’ custody Starting point High level community order Starting point Medium level community order Category range High level community order – 1 year 6 months’ custody Category range Low level community order – 36 weeks’ custody Category range Band B fine – 26 weeks’ custody Fines Starting point 	Range Fine Band A 	 50% of relevant weekly income 	 25 – 75% of relevant weekly income Fine Band B 	 100% of relevant weekly income 	 75 – 125% of relevant weekly income Fine Band C 	 150% of relevant weekly income 	125 – 175% of relevant weekly income Fine Band D 	 250% of relevant weekly income 	200 – 300% of relevant weekly income Fine Band E 	400% of relevant weekly income 	300 – 500% of relevant weekly income Fine Band F 	 600% of relevant weekly income 	 500 – 700% of relevant weekly income The court should determine the appropriate level of fine in accordance with this guideline and section 125 of the Sentencing Code, which requires that the fine must reflect the seriousness of the offence and that the court must take into account the financial circumstances of the offender. Where possible, if a financial penalty is imposed, it should remove any economic benefit the offender has derived through the commission of the offence including: avoided costs; operating savings; any gain made as a direct result of the offence. The fine should meet, in a fair and proportionate way, the objectives of punishment, deterrence and the removal of gain derived through the commission of the offence; it should not be cheaper to offend than to comply with the law. In considering economic benefit, the court should avoid double recovery. Where the means of the offender are limited, priority should be given to compensation (where applicable) over payment of any other financial penalty. Where it is not possible to calculate or estimate the economic benefit, the court may wish to draw on information from the enforcing authorities about the general costs of operating within the law. When sentencing organisations the fine must be sufficiently substantial to have a real economic impact which will bring home to both management and shareholders the need to comply with the law.  The court should ensure that the effect of the fine (particularly if it will result in closure of the business) is proportionate to the gravity of the offence. Obtaining financial information: It is for the offender to disclose to the court such data relevant to their financial position as will enable it to assess what they can reasonably afford to pay. If necessary, the court may compel the disclosure of an individual offender’s financial circumstances pursuant to section 35 of the Sentencing Code. In the absence of such disclosure, or where the court is not satisfied that it has been given sufficient reliable information, the court will be entitled to draw reasonable inferences as to the offender’s means from evidence it has heard and from all the circumstances of the case. In setting a fine, the court may conclude that the offender is able to pay any fine imposed unless the offender has supplied financial information to the contrary. Community orders For further information see Imposition of community and custodial sentences. The seriousness of the offence should be the initial factor in determining which requirements to include in a community order. Offence specific guidelines refer to three sentencing levels within the community order band based on offence seriousness (low, medium and high). The culpability and harm present in the offence(s) should be considered to identify which of the three sentencing levels within the community order band is appropriate. See below for non-exhaustive examples of requirements that might be appropriate in each. At least one requirement MUST be imposed for the purpose of punishment and/or a fine imposed in addition to the community order unless there are exceptional circumstances which relate to the offence or the offender that would make it unjust in all the circumstances to do so. A suspended sentence MUST NOT be imposed as a more severe form of community order. A suspended sentence is a custodial sentence. Community orders can fulfil all of the purposes of sentencing. In particular, they can have the effect of restricting the offender’s liberty while providing punishment in the community, rehabilitation for the offender, and/or ensuring that the offender engages in reparative activities. A community order must not be imposed unless the offence is ‘serious enough to warrant such a sentence’. Where an offender is being sentenced for a non-imprisonable offence, there is no power to make a community order. Sentencers must consider all available disposals at the time of sentence; even where the threshold for a community sentence has been passed, a fine or discharge may be an appropriate penalty. In particular, a Band D fine may be an appropriate alternative to a community order. The court must ensure that the restriction on the offender’s liberty is commensurate with the seriousness of the offence and that the requirements imposed are the most suitable for the offender. Sentences should not necessarily escalate from one community order range to the next on each sentencing occasion. The decision as to the appropriate range of community order should be based upon the seriousness of the new offence(s) (which will take into account any previous convictions). In many cases, a pre-sentence report will be pivotal in helping the court decide whether to impose a community order and, if so, whether particular requirements or combinations of requirements are suitable for an individual offender. Whenever the court reaches the provisional view that a community order may be appropriate, it should request a pre-sentence report (whether written or verbal) unless the court is of the opinion that a report is unnecessary in all the circumstances of the case. It may be helpful to indicate to the Probation Service the court’s preliminary opinion as to which of the three sentencing ranges is relevant and the purpose(s) of sentencing that the package of requirements is expected to fulfil. Ideally a pre-sentence report should be completed on the same day to avoid adjourning the case. If an adjournment cannot be avoided, the information should be provided to the Probation Service in written form and a copy retained on the court file for the benefit of the sentencing court. However, the court must make clear to the offender that all sentencing options remain open including, in appropriate cases, committal for sentence to the Crown Court. Low 	Medium 	High Offences only just cross community order threshold, where the seriousness of the offence or the nature of the offender’s record means that a discharge or fine is inappropriate In general, only one requirement will be appropriate and the length may be curtailed if additional requirements are necessary Offences that obviously fall within the community order band 	Offences only just fall below the custody threshold or the custody threshold is crossed but a community order is more appropriate in the circumstances More intensive sentences which combine two or more requirements may be appropriate Suitable requirements might include: Any appropriate rehabilitative requirement(s) 40 – 80 hours of unpaid work Curfew requirement for example up to 16 hours per day for a few weeks** Exclusion requirement, for a few months Prohibited activity requirement Suitable requirements might include: Any appropriate rehabilitative requirement(s) 80 – 150 hours of unpaid work Curfew requirement for example up to 16 hours per day for 2 – 3 months** Exclusion requirement lasting in the region of 6 months Prohibited activity requirement Suitable requirements might include: Any appropriate rehabilitative requirement(s) 150 – 300 hours of unpaid work Curfew requirement for example up to 16 hours per day for 4 – 12 months** Exclusion requirement lasting in the region of 12 months If order does not contain a punitive requirement, suggested fine levels are indicated below: BAND A FINE BAND B FINE BAND C FINE **Note: Changes to the curfew requirements brought in by the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 are set out in the Requirements section in the Overarching Guideline: Imposition of community and custodial sentences, but are not reflected in the ranges above. Custodial sentences Sentencing flowcharts are available at Imposition of Community and Custodial Sentences definitive guideline. The approach to the imposition of a custodial sentence should be as follows: 1) Has the custody threshold been passed? A custodial sentence must not be imposed unless the offence or the combination of the offence and one or more offences associated with it was so serious that neither a fine alone nor a community sentence can be justified for the offence. There is no general definition of where the custody threshold lies. The circumstances of the individual offence and the factors assessed by offence-specific guidelines will determine whether an offence is so serious that neither a fine alone nor a community sentence can be justified. Where no offence specific guideline is available to determine seriousness, the harm caused by the offence, the culpability of the offender and any previous convictions will be relevant to the assessment. The clear intention of the threshold test is to reserve prison as a punishment for the most serious offences. 2) Is it unavoidable that a sentence of imprisonment be imposed? Passing the custody threshold does not mean that a custodial sentence should be deemed inevitable. Custody should not be imposed where a community order could provide sufficient restriction on an offender’s liberty (by way of punishment) while addressing the rehabilitation of the offender to prevent future crime. For offenders on the cusp of custody, imprisonment should not be imposed where there would be an impact on dependants which would make a custodial sentence disproportionate to achieving the aims of sentencing. 3) What is the shortest term commensurate with the seriousness of the offence? In considering this the court must NOT consider any licence or post sentence supervision requirements which may subsequently be imposed upon the offender’s release. 4) Can the sentence be suspended? A suspended sentence MUST NOT be imposed as a more severe form of community order. A suspended sentence is a custodial sentence. Sentencers should be clear that they would impose an immediate custodial sentence if the power to suspend were not available. If not, a non-custodial sentence should be imposed. The following factors should be weighed in considering whether it is possible to suspend the sentence: Factors indicating that it would not be appropriate to suspend a custodial sentence Factors indicating that it may be appropriate to suspend a custodial sentence Offender presents a risk/danger to the public Realistic prospect of rehabilitation Appropriate punishment can only be achieved by immediate custody Strong personal mitigation History of poor compliance with court orders Immediate custody will result in significant harmful impact upon others The imposition of a custodial sentence is both punishment and a deterrent. To ensure that the overall terms of the suspended sentence are commensurate with offence seriousness, care must be taken to ensure requirements imposed are not excessive. A court wishing to impose onerous or intensive requirements should reconsider whether a community sentence might be more appropriate. Pre-sentence report Whenever the court reaches the provisional view that: the custody threshold has been passed; and, if so the length of imprisonment which represents the shortest term commensurate with the seriousness of the offence; the court should obtain a pre-sentence report, whether verbal or written, unless the court considers a report to be unnecessary. Ideally a pre-sentence report should be completed on the same day to avoid adjourning the case. Magistrates: Consult your legal adviser before deciding to sentence to custody without a pre-sentence report. Suspended Sentences: General Guidance i) The guidance regarding pre-sentence reports applies if suspending custody. ii) If the court imposes a term of imprisonment of between 14 days and 2 years (subject to magistrates’ courts sentencing powers), it may suspend the sentence for between 6 months and 2 years (the ‘operational period’). The time for which a sentence is suspended should reflect the length of the sentence; up to 12 months might normally be appropriate for a suspended sentence of up to 6 months. iii) Where the court imposes two or more sentences to be served consecutively, the court may suspend the sentence where the aggregate of the terms is between 14 days and 2 years (subject to magistrates’ courts sentencing powers). iv) When the court suspends a sentence, it may impose one or more requirements for the offender to undertake in the community. The requirements are identical to those available for community orders, see the guideline on Imposition of Community and Custodial Sentences. v) A custodial sentence that is suspended should be for the same term that would have applied if the sentence was to be served immediately. The table below contains a non-exhaustive list of additional factual elements providing the context of the offence and factors relating to the offender. Identify whether any combination of these, or other relevant factors, should result in an upward or downward adjustment from the starting point. In some cases, having considered these factors, it may be appropriate to move outside the identified category range. Factors increasing seriousness Statutory aggravating factors: Previous convictions, Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence Guidance on the use of previous convictions The following guidance should be considered when seeking to determine the degree to which previous convictions should aggravate sentence: Section 65 of the Sentencing Code states that: (1) This section applies where a court is considering the seriousness of an offence (“the current offence”) committed by an offender who has one or more relevant previous convictions. (2) The court must treat as an aggravating factor each relevant previous conviction that it considers can reasonably be so treated, having regard in particular to— (a) the nature of the offence to which the conviction relates and its relevance to the current offence, and (b) the time that has elapsed since the conviction. (3) Where the court treats a relevant previous conviction as an aggravating factor under subsection (2) it must state in open court that the offence is so aggravated. Previous convictions are considered at step two in the Council’s offence-specific guidelines. The primary significance of previous convictions (including convictions in other jurisdictions) is the extent to which they indicate trends in offending behaviour and possibly the offender’s response to earlier sentences. Previous convictions are normally of relevance to the current offence when they are of a similar type. Previous convictions of a type different from the current offence may be of relevance where they are an indication of persistent offending or escalation and/or a failure to comply with previous court orders. Numerous and frequent previous convictions might indicate an underlying problem (for example, an addiction) that could be addressed more effectively in the community and will not necessarily indicate that a custodial sentence is necessary. If the offender received a non-custodial disposal for the previous offence, a court should not necessarily move to a custodial sentence for the fresh offence. In cases involving significant persistent offending, the community and custody thresholds may be crossed even though the current offence normally warrants a lesser sentence. If a custodial sentence is imposed it should be proportionate and kept to the necessary minimum. The aggravating effect of relevant previous convictions reduces with the passage of time; older convictions are of less relevance to the offender’s culpability for the current offence and less likely to be predictive of future offending. Where the previous offence is particularly old it will normally have little relevance for the current sentencing exercise. The court should consider the time gap since the previous conviction and the reason for it. Where there has been a significant gap between previous and current convictions or a reduction in the frequency of offending this may indicate that the offender has made attempts to desist from offending in which case the aggravating effect of the previous offending will diminish. Where the current offence is significantly less serious than the previous conviction (suggesting a decline in the gravity of offending), the previous conviction may carry less weight. When considering the totality of previous offending a court should take a rounded view of the previous crimes and not simply aggregate the individual offences. Where information is available on the context of previous offending this may assist the court in assessing the relevance of that prior offending to the current offence having regard to a) the nature of the offence to which the conviction relates and its relevance to the current offence; and b) the time that has elapsed since the conviction Offence committed whilst on bail Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence Section 64 of the Sentencing Code states: In considering the seriousness of any offence committed while the offender was on bail, the court must - (a) treat the fact that it was committed in those circumstances as an aggravating factor and (b) state in open court that the offence is so aggravated.  Offence motivated by, or demonstrating hostility based on any of the following characteristics or presumed characteristics of the victim: disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence See below for the statutory provisions. Note the requirement for the court to state that the offence has been aggravated by the relevant hostility. Where the element of hostility is core to the offending, the aggravation will be higher than where it plays a lesser role. Section 66 of the Sentencing Code states: Hostility (1) This section applies where a court is considering the seriousness of an offence which is aggravated by—(a) racial hostility, (b) religious hostility, (c) hostility related to disability, (d) hostility related to sexual orientation, or (e) hostility related to transgender identity. This is subject to subsection (3). (2) The court—(a) must treat the fact that the offence is aggravated by hostility of any of those types as an aggravating factor, and (b) must state in open court that the offence is so aggravated. (3) So far as it relates to racial and religious hostility, this section does not apply in relation to an offence under sections 29 to 32 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (racially or religiously aggravated offences). (4) For the purposes of this section, an offence is aggravated by hostility of one of the kinds mentioned in subsection (1) if—(a) at the time of committing the offence, or immediately before or after doing so, the offender demonstrated towards the victim of the offence hostility based on—(i) the victim’s membership (or presumed membership) of a racial group, (ii) the victim’s membership (or presumed membership) of a religious group, (iii) a disability (or presumed disability) of the victim, (iv) the sexual orientation (or presumed sexual orientation) of the victim, or (as the case may be) (v) the victim being (or being presumed to be) transgender, or (b) the offence was motivated (wholly or partly) by—(i) hostility towards members of a racial group based on their membership of that group, (ii) hostility towards members of a religious group based on their membership of that group, (iii) hostility towards persons who have a disability or a particular disability, (iv) hostility towards persons who are of a particular sexual orientation, or (as the case may be) (v) hostility towards persons who are transgender. (5) For the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (4), it is immaterial whether or not the offender’s hostility is also based, to any extent, on any other factor not mentioned in that paragraph. (6) In this section—(a) references to a racial group are to a group of persons defined by reference to race, colour, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins; (b) references to a religious group are to a group of persons defined by reference to religious belief or lack of religious belief; (c) “membership” in relation to a racial or religious group, includes association with members of that group; (d) “disability” means any physical or mental impairment; (e) references to being transgender include references to being transsexual, or undergoing, proposing to undergo or having undergone a process or part of a process of gender reassignment; (f) “presumed” means presumed by the offender. Offence was committed against an emergency worker acting in the exercise of functions as such a worker Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence See below for the statutory provisions. Note the requirement for the court to state that the offence has been so aggravated. Note this statutory factor only applies to certain violent or sexual offences as listed below. For other offences the factor ‘Victim was providing a public service or performing a public duty at the time of the offence’ can be applied where relevant. The Sentencing Code states: 67 Assaults on emergency workers (1) This section applies where a court is considering the seriousness of an offence listed in subsection (3). (2) If the offence was committed against an emergency worker acting in the exercise of functions as such a worker, the court—(a) must treat that fact as an aggravating factor, and (b) must state in open court that the offence is so aggravated. (3) The offences referred to in subsection (1) are—(a) an offence under any of the following provisions of the Offences against the Person Act 1861—(i) section 16 (threats to kill); (ii) section 18 (wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm); (iii) section 20 (malicious wounding); (iv) section 23 (administering poison etc); (v) section 28 (causing bodily injury by explosives); (vi) section 29 (using explosives etc with intent to do grievous bodily harm); (vii) section 47 (assault occasioning actual bodily harm); (b) an offence under section 3 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (sexual assault); (c) manslaughter; (d) kidnapping; (e) an inchoate offence in relation to any of the preceding offences. (4) For the purposes of subsection (2) the circumstances in which an offence is to be taken as committed against a person acting in the exercise of functions as an emergency worker include circumstances where the offence takes place at a time when the person is not at work but is carrying out functions which, if done in work time, would have been in the exercise of functions as an emergency worker. (5) In this section, “emergency worker” has the meaning given by section 68. (6) Nothing in this section prevents a court from treating the fact that an offence was committed against an emergency worker acting in the exercise of functions as such as an aggravating factor in relation to offences not listed in subsection (3). 68 Emergency workers for the purposes of section 67 (1) In section 67, “emergency worker” means—(a) a constable; (b) a person (other than a constable) who has the powers of a constable or is otherwise employed for police purposes or is engaged to provide services for police purposes; (c) a National Crime Agency officer; (d) a prison officer; (e) a person (other than a prison officer) employed or engaged to carry out functions in a custodial institution of a corresponding kind to those carried out by a prison officer; (f) a prisoner custody officer, so far as relating to the exercise of escort functions; (g) a custody officer, so far as relating to the exercise of escort functions; (h) a person employed for the purposes of providing, or engaged to provide, fire services or fire and rescue services; (i) a person employed for the purposes of providing, or engaged to provide, search services or rescue services (or both); (j) a person employed for the purposes of providing, or engaged to provide—(i) NHS health services, or (ii) services in the support of the provision of NHS health services, and whose general activities in doing so involve face to face interaction with individuals receiving the services or with other members of the public. (2) It is immaterial for the purposes of subsection (1) whether the employment or engagement is paid or unpaid. (3) In this section— “custodial institution” means any of the following—(a) a prison; (b) a young offender institution, secure training centre or secure college; (c) a removal centre, a short-term holding facility or pre-departure accommodation, as defined by section 147 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999; (d) services custody premises, as defined by section 300(7) of the Armed Forces Act 2006;“custody officer” has the meaning given by section 12(3) of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994; “escort functions”—(a) in the case of a prisoner custody officer, means the functions specified in section 80(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991; (b) in the case of a custody officer, means the functions specified in paragraph 1 of Schedule 1 to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994;“NHS health services” means any kind of health services provided as part of the health service continued under section 1(1) of the National Health Service Act 2006 and under section 1(1) of the National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006; “prisoner custody officer” has the meaning given by section 89(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Offence was committed against person providing a public service, performing a public duty or providing services to the public Effective in relation to convictions on or after 28 June 2022 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence See below for the statutory provisions. Note the requirement for the court to state that the offence has been so aggravated. Note this statutory factor only applies to certain violent offences as listed below. For other offences the aggravating factor relating to offences committed against those working in the public sector or providing a service to the public can be applied where relevant. The Sentencing Code states: 68A Assaults on those providing a public service etc (1) This section applies where—(a) a court is considering the seriousness of an offence listed in subsection (3), and (b) the offence is not aggravated under section 67(2). (2) If the offence was committed against a person providing a public service, performing a public duty or providing services to the public, the court—(a) must treat that fact as an aggravating factor, and (b) must state in open court that the offence is so aggravated. (3) The offences referred to in subsection (1) are—(a) an offence of common assault or battery, except where section 1 of the Assaults on Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018 applies; (b) an offence under any of the following provisions of the Offences against the Person Act 1861—(i) section 16 (threats to kill); (ii) section 18 (wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm); (iii) section 20 (malicious wounding); (iv) section 47 (assault occasioning actual bodily harm); (c) an inchoate offence in relation to any of the preceding offences. (4) In this section—(a) a reference to providing services to the public includes a reference to providing goods or facilities to the public; (b) a reference to the public includes a reference to a section of the public. (5) Nothing in this section prevents a court from treating the fact that an offence was committed against a person providing a public service, performing a public duty or providing services to the public as an aggravating factor in relation to offences not listed in subsection (3). (6) This section has effect in relation to a person who is convicted of the offence on or after the date on which section 156 of the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act 2022 comes into force. Other aggravating factors: Deliberate spitting or coughing Offence committed against those working in the public sector or providing a service to the public or against a person coming to the assistance of an emergency worker Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence This reflects: the fact that people in public facing roles are more exposed to the possibility of harm and consequently more vulnerable and/or the fact that someone is working in the public interest merits the additional protection of the courts. This applies whether the victim is a public or private employee or acting in a voluntary capacity. Care should be taken to avoid double counting where the statutory aggravating factor relating to emergency workers or to those providing a public service, performing a public duty or providing services to the public applies. Offence committed in prison (where not taken into account as a statutory aggravating factor) Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence Offences committed in custody are more serious because they undermine the fundamental need for control and order which is necessary for the running of prisons and maintaining safety. Generally the sentence for the new offence will be consecutive to the sentence being served as it will have arisen out of an unrelated incident. The court must have regard to the totality of the offender’s criminality when passing the second sentence, to ensure that the total sentence to be served is just and proportionate. Refer to the Totality guideline for detailed guidance. Care should be taken to avoid double counting matters taken into account when considering previous convictions. Offence committed in a domestic context Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence Refer to the Overarching Principles: Domestic Abuse Definitive Guideline History of violence or abuse towards victim by offender Presence of children Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence This reflects the psychological harm that may be caused to those who witnessed the offence. The presence of one or more children may in some situations make the primary victim more vulnerable – for example an adult may be less able to resist the offender if concerned about the safety or welfare of children present. When sentencing young adult offenders (typically aged 18-25), consideration should also be given to the guidance on the mitigating factor relating to age and/or lack of maturity when considering the significance of this factor. Gratuitous degradation of victim Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence Where an offender deliberately causes additional harm to a victim over and above that which is an essential element of the offence - this will increase seriousness. Examples may include, but are not limited to, posts of images on social media designed to cause additional distress to the victim. Where any such actions are the subject of separate charges, this should be taken into account when assessing totality. When sentencing young adult offenders (typically aged 18-25), consideration should also be given to the guidance on the mitigating factor relating to age and/or lack of maturity when considering the significance of this factor. Abuse of power and/or position of trust Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence A close examination of the facts is necessary and a clear justification should be given if abuse of trust is to be found. In order for an abuse of trust to make an offence more serious the relationship between the offender and victim(s) must be one that would give rise to the offender having a significant level of responsibility towards the victim(s) on which the victim(s) would be entitled to rely. Abuse of trust may occur in many factual situations. Examples may include relationships such as teacher and pupil, parent and child, employer and employee, professional adviser and client, or carer (whether paid or unpaid) and dependant.  It may also include ad hoc situations such as a late-night taxi driver and a lone passenger.  These examples are not exhaustive and do not necessarily indicate that abuse of trust is present. Additionally an offence may be made more serious where an offender has abused their position to facilitate and/or conceal offending. Where an offender has been given an inappropriate level of responsibility, abuse of trust is unlikely to apply. Any steps taken to prevent the victim reporting an incident, obtaining assistance and/or from assisting or supporting the prosecution Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence The more sophisticated, extensive or persistent the actions after the event, the more likely it is to increase the seriousness of the offence. When sentencing young adult offenders (typically aged 18-25), consideration should also be given to the guidance on the mitigating factor relating to age and lack of maturity when considering the significance of such conduct. Where any such actions are the subject of separate charges, this should be taken into account when assessing totality. Commission of offence whilst under the influence of alcohol/drugs Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence The fact that an offender is voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the offence will tend to increase the seriousness of the offence provided that the intoxication has contributed to the offending. This applies regardless of whether the offender is under the influence of legal or illegal substance(s). In the case of a person addicted to drugs or alcohol the intoxication may be considered not to be voluntary, but the court should have regard to the extent to which the offender has sought help or engaged with any assistance which has been offered or made available in dealing with the addiction. An offender who has voluntarily consumed drugs and/or alcohol must accept the consequences of the behaviour that results, even if it is out of character. Offence committed whilst on licence or subject to post sentence supervision Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence An offender who is subject to licence or post sentence supervision is under a particular obligation to desist from further offending. The extent to which the offender has complied with the conditions of a licence or order (including the time that has elapsed since its commencement) will be a relevant consideration. Where the offender is dealt with separately for a breach of a licence or order regard should be had to totality. Care should be taken to avoid double counting matters taken into account when considering previous convictions. When sentencing young adult offenders (typically aged 18-25), consideration should also be given to the guidance on the mitigating factor relating to age and/or lack of maturity when considering the significance of this factor. Failure to comply with current court orders Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence Commission of an offence while subject to a relevant court order makes the offence more serious. The extent to which the offender has complied with the conditions of an order (including the time that has elapsed since its commencement) will be a relevant consideration. Where the offender is dealt with separately for a breach of an order regard should be had to totality Care should be taken to avoid double counting matters taken into account when considering previous convictions. When sentencing young adult offenders (typically aged 18-25), consideration should also be given to the guidance on the mitigating factor relating to age and/or lack of maturity when considering the significance of this factor. Factors reducing seriousness or reflecting personal mitigation No previous convictions or no relevant/recent convictions Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm First time offenders usually represent a lower risk of reoffending. Reoffending rates for first offenders are significantly lower than rates for repeat offenders. In addition, first offenders are normally regarded as less blameworthy than offenders who have committed the same crime several times already. For these reasons first offenders receive a mitigated sentence. Where there are previous offences but these are old and /or are for offending of a different nature, the sentence will normally be reduced to reflect that the new offence is not part of a pattern of offending and there is therefore a lower likelihood of reoffending. When assessing whether a previous conviction is ‘recent’ the court should consider the time gap since the previous conviction and the reason for it. Previous convictions are likely to be ‘relevant’ when they share characteristics with the current offence (examples of such characteristics include, but are not limited to: dishonesty, violence, abuse of position or trust, use or possession of weapons, disobedience of court orders).  In general the more serious the previous offending the longer it will retain relevance. Remorse Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm The court will need to be satisfied that the offender is genuinely remorseful for the offending behaviour in order to reduce the sentence (separate from any guilty plea reduction). Lack of remorse should never be treated as an aggravating factor. Remorse can present itself in many different ways. A simple assertion of the fact may be insufficient, and the offender’s demeanour in court could be misleading, due to nervousness, a lack of understanding of the system, a belief that they have been or will be discriminated against, peer pressure to behave in a certain way because of others present, a lack of maturity etc. If a PSR has been prepared it may provide valuable assistance in this regard. Good character and/or exemplary conduct Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm This factor may apply whether or not the offender has previous convictions.  Evidence that an offender has demonstrated positive good character through, for example, charitable works may reduce the sentence. However, this factor is less likely to be relevant where the offending is very serious.  Where an offender has used their good character or status to facilitate or conceal the offending it could be treated as an aggravating factor. Significant degree of provocation History of significant violence or abuse towards the offender by the victim Age and/or lack of maturity Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm Age and/or lack of maturity can affect: the offender’s responsibility for the offence and the effect of the sentence on the offender. Either or both of these considerations may justify a reduction in the sentence. The emotional and developmental age of an offender is of at least equal importance to their chronological age (if not greater). In particular young adults (typically aged 18-25) are still developing neurologically and consequently may be less able to: evaluate the consequences of their actions limit impulsivity limit risk taking Young adults are likely to be susceptible to peer pressure and are more likely to take risks or behave impulsively when in company with their peers. Immaturity can also result from atypical brain development. Environment plays a role in neurological development and factors such as adverse childhood experiences including deprivation and/or abuse may affect development. An immature offender may find it particularly difficult to cope with custody and therefore may be more susceptible to self-harm in custody. An immature offender may find it particularly difficult to cope with the requirements of a community order without appropriate support. There is a greater capacity for change in immature offenders and they may be receptive to opportunities to address their offending behaviour and change their conduct. Many young people who offend either stop committing crime, or begin a process of stopping, in their late teens and early twenties.  Therefore a young adult’s previous convictions may not be indicative of a tendency for further offending. Where the offender is a care leaver the court should enquire as to any effect a sentence may have on the offender’s ability to make use of support from the local authority. (Young adult care leavers are entitled to time limited support. Leaving care services may change at the age of 21 and cease at the age of 25, unless the young adult is in education at that point). See also the Sentencing Children and Young People Guideline (paragraphs 1.16 and 1.17). Where an offender has turned 18 between the commission of the offence and conviction the court should take as its starting point the sentence likely to have been imposed on the date at which the offence was committed, but applying the purposes of sentencing adult offenders. See also the Sentencing Children and Young People Guideline (paragraphs 6.1 to 6.3). When considering a custodial or community sentence for a young adult the Probation Service should address these issues in a PSR. Mental disorder or learning disability, where not linked to the commission of the offence Effective from: 01 October 2020 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence Refer to the Sentencing offenders with mental disorders, developmental disorders, or neurological impairments guideline. Note in particular paragraph 5 for Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic offenders. Sole or primary carer for dependent relative(s) Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm This factor is particularly relevant where an offender is on the cusp of custody or where the suitability of a community order is being considered.  See also the Imposition of community and custodial sentences guideline. For offenders on the cusp of custody, imprisonment should not be imposed where there would be an impact on dependants which would make a custodial sentence disproportionate to achieving the aims of sentencing. Where custody is unavoidable consideration of the impact on dependants may be relevant to the length of the sentence imposed and whether the sentence can be suspended. For more serious offences where a substantial period of custody is appropriate, this factor will carry less weight. ­When imposing a community sentence on an offender with primary caring responsibilities the effect on dependants must be considered in determining suitable requirements. In addition when sentencing an offender who is pregnant relevant considerations may include: any effect of the sentence on the health of the offender and any effect of the sentence on the unborn child The court should ensure that it has all relevant information about dependent children before deciding on sentence. When an immediate custodial sentence is necessary, the court must consider whether proper arrangements have been made for the care of any dependent children and if necessary consider adjourning sentence for this to be done. When considering a community or custodial sentence for an offender who has, or may have, caring responsibilities the court should ask the Probation Service to address these issues in a PSR. Useful information can be found in the Equal Treatment Bench Book (see in particular Chapter 6 paragraphs 131 to 137) Determination and/or demonstration of steps taken to address addiction or offending behaviour Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence Where offending is driven by or closely associated with drug or alcohol abuse (for example stealing to feed a habit, or committing acts of disorder or violence whilst drunk) a commitment to address the underlying issue may justify a reduction in sentence.  This will be particularly relevant where the court is considering whether to impose a sentence that focuses on rehabilitation. Similarly, a commitment to address other underlying issues that may influence the offender’s behaviour may justify the imposition of a sentence that focusses on rehabilitation. The court will be assisted by a PSR in making this assessment. Serious medical conditions requiring urgent, intensive or long-term treatment Effective from: 01 October 2019 Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors including those already taken into account in assessing culpability or harm or those inherent in the offence The court can take account of physical disability or a serious medical condition by way of mitigation as a reason for reducing the length of the sentence, either on the ground of the greater impact which imprisonment will have on the offender, or as a matter of generally expressed mercy in the individual circumstances of the case. However, such a condition, even when it is difficult to treat in prison, will not automatically entitle the offender to a lesser sentence than would otherwise be appropriate. There will always be a need to balance issues personal to an offender against the gravity of the offending (including the harm done to victims), and the public interest in imposing appropriate punishment for serious offending. A terminal prognosis is not in itself a reason to reduce the sentence even further. The court must impose a sentence that properly meets the aims of sentencing even if it will carry the clear prospect that the offender will die in custody. The prospect of death in the near future will be a matter considered by the prison authorities and the Secretary of State under the early release on compassionate grounds procedure (ERCG). But, an offender’s knowledge that he will likely face the prospect of death in prison, subject only to the ERCG provisions, is a factor that can be considered by the sentencing judge when determining the sentence that it would be just to impose. Step 3 – Aggravated offences SECTION 29 RACIALLY OR RELIGIOUSLY AGGRAVATED OFFENCES ONLY Having determined the category of the basic offence to identify the sentence of a non-aggravated offence, the court should now consider the level of racial or religious aggravation involved and apply an appropriate uplift to the sentence in accordance with the guidance below. The following is a list of factors which the court should consider to determine the level of aggravation. Where there are characteristics present which fall under different levels of aggravation, the court should balance these to reach a fair assessment of the level of aggravation present in the offence. Maximum sentence for the aggravated offence on indictment is 7 years’ custody (maximum when tried summarily is 6 months’ custody) Care should be taken to avoid double counting factors already taken into account in assessing the level of harm at step one HIGH LEVEL OF RACIAL OR RELIGIOUS AGGRAVATION SENTENCE UPLIFT Racial or religious aggravation was the predominant motivation for the offence. Offender was a member of, or was associated with, a group promoting hostility based on race or religion. Aggravated nature of the offence caused severe distress to the victim or the victim’s family (over and above the distress already considered at step one). Aggravated nature of the offence caused serious fear and distress throughout local community or more widely. Increase the length of custodial sentence if already considered for the basic offence or consider a custodial sentence, if not already considered for the basic offence. MEDIUM LEVEL OF RACIAL OR RELIGIOUS AGGRAVATION SENTENCE UPLIFT Racial or religious aggravation formed a significant proportion of the offence as a whole. Aggravated nature of the offence caused some distress to the victim or the victim’s family (over and above the distress already considered at step one). Aggravated nature of the offence caused some fear and distress throughout local community or more widely. Consider a significantly more onerous penalty of the same type or consider a more severe type of sentence than for the basic offence. LOW LEVEL OF RACIAL OR RELIGIOUS AGGRAVATION SENTENCE UPLIFT Aggravated element formed a minimal part of the offence as a whole. Aggravated nature of the offence caused minimal or no distress to the victim or the victim’s family (over and above the distress already considered at step one). Consider a more onerous penalty of the same type identified for the basic offence. Magistrates may find that, although the appropriate sentence for the basic offence would be within their powers, the appropriate increase for the aggravated offence would result in a sentence in excess of their powers. If so, they must commit for sentence to the Crown Court. The sentencer should state in open court that the offence was aggravated by reason of race or religion, and should also state what the sentence would have been without that element of aggravation. Step 4 – Consider any other factors which indicate a reduction, such as assistance to the prosecution The court should take into account section 74 of the Sentencing Code (reduction in sentence for assistance to prosecution) and any other rule of law by virtue of which an offender may receive a discounted sentence in consequence of assistance given (or offered) to the prosecutor or investigator. Step 5 – Reduction for guilty pleas The court should take account of any potential reduction for a guilty plea in accordance with section 73 of the Sentencing Code and the Reduction in Sentence for a Guilty Plea guideline. Step 6 – Dangerousness The court should consider whether having regard to the criteria contained in Chapter 6 of Part 10 of the Sentencing Code it would be appropriate to impose an extended sentence (sections 266 and 279). Step 7 – Totality principle If sentencing an offender for more than one offence, or where the offender is already serving a sentence, consider whether the total sentence is just and proportionate to the offending behaviour. See Totality guideline. Step 8 – Compensation and ancillary orders In all cases, the court should consider whether to make compensation and/or other ancillary orders. The court must give reasons if it decides not to order compensation (Sentencing Code, s.55). Ancillary orders – Magistrates’ Court Ancillary orders – Crown Court Compendium Step 9 – Reasons Section 52 of the Sentencing Code imposes a duty to give reasons for, and explain the effect of, the sentence. Step 10 – Consideration for time spent on bail (tagged curfew) The court must consider whether to give credit for time spent on bail in accordance with section 240A of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 and section 325 of the Sentencing Code.
