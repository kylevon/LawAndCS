This applies regardless of whether the offender is under the influence of legal or illegal substance(s). In the case of a person addicted to drugs or alcohol the intoxication may be considered not to be voluntary, but the court should have regard to the extent to which the offender has sought help or engaged with any assistance which has been offered or made available in dealing with the addiction. An offender who has voluntarily consumed drugs and/or alcohol must accept the consequences of the behaviour that results, even if it is out of character.",
        "comments": "Intoxication tends to increase the seriousness of the case (aggravating factor) if the person was voluntarily intoxicated and if it contributed to the crime. The case lacks details of whether the intoxication contributed to the crime. Since the attack was rather out of character for her, an argument can be made that the alcohol was relevant for her decision to attack."
